# UNSW-NB15 Dataset: A Story of Cyber Attack Detection

---

## 🧠 Objective

In today's interconnected world, network systems are critical for everything from banking to education, healthcare to government. However, these systems are more vulnerable than ever to cyberattacks. This makes **Intrusion Detection** a cornerstone of cybersecurity.

The UNSW-NB15 dataset was created to help researchers and developers build **intrusion detection algorithms using realistic network traffic**.

---

## 🏛️ Who Created It?

* The dataset was developed by the **Cyber Range Lab** at the **University of New South Wales (UNSW)** in Australia.
* The **IXIA PerfectStorm simulator** was used for data generation.
* Created in 2015, the dataset is still widely used in academic publications today.

---

## 🌐 How Was the Data Collected?

1.  **Realistic network traffic** was generated by simulating both normal user behaviors and various cyberattacks.
2.  Simulations were run on different days and at different times to create data spread across **various timeframes**.
3.  Network traffic data was collected to include both **normal connections** and **9 different attack types**.

---

## 🚨 Included Attack Types

The dataset features a diverse range of attack categories:

1.  **Fuzzers**
2.  **Analysis**
3.  **Backdoors**
4.  **DoS (Denial of Service)**
5.  **Exploits**
6.  **Generic**
7.  **Reconnaissance**
8.  **Shellcode**
9.  **Worms**

> This diversity makes the dataset suitable for both **supervised** and **unsupervised learning** techniques.

## 🎯 Purpose in Education

This dataset is ideal for students to:

* **Simulate real-world problems.**
* Gain **awareness of attack detection and cybersecurity**.
* Apply **anomaly detection, classification, and clustering algorithms**.

Additionally, the inherent imbalance in the data, similar to **fraud detection** scenarios, makes it excellent for developing machine learning modeling skills in realistic contexts.

## Unsupervised Learning for Network-Based Attack Detection: DBSCAN vs. Isolation Forest

---

### 🎯 Objective

This part of the project aims to test whether cyberattacks can be detected as **anomalies** using unsupervised methods, *without* relying on the "normal" and "attack" labels in the dataset.

---

### ✅ Steps

1.  **Data Preparation**
    * Download the UNSW-NB15 dataset.
    * Select only numerical columns (or convert categorical data).
    * Choose 2000 samples from "normal" and 500 samples from "attack" instances.

2.  **Preprocessing**
    * Clean missing data if necessary.
    * Scale features using `StandardScaler`.

3.  **DBSCAN Application**
    * Experiment with `eps` and `min_samples` settings.
    * Visualize the results using PCA.
    * Compare with the true labels (confusion matrix, precision-recall).

4.  **Isolation Forest Application**
    * Apply to the same dataset.
    * (Optional Bonus) Adjust the `contamination` rate (e.g., `model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.05)`).
    * Again, compare with the true labels.

5.  **Comparison**
    * Which method resulted in fewer errors?
    * Which method detected more attacks?
    * Evaluate using Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

6.  **Interpreting Results**
    * Discuss in written form which model might be more useful in which scenario.
